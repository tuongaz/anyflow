/**
 * US-019: small lock indicator rendered on a node's top-right corner when
 * the node is locked. Absolutely positioned outside the node's content flow
 * so it never affects the node's bounding box; offset above the top edge so
 * it doesn't overlap the top-middle connection handle. Every node renderer
 * (play, state, shape, image, icon, group) reads `data.locked` and renders
 * this badge directly — there is no shared wrapper layer in xyflow we can
 * inject chrome through.
 *
 * US-018: the badge keeps `pointer-events: auto` (default) so it is the
 * event target when the cursor is over its visible area. Because the badge
 * is offset at `-top-2 -right-2`, it sits OUTSIDE the xyflow `.react-flow__node`
 * wrapper's geometry — but it's still a DOM descendant of the wrapper. With
 * pointer-events enabled, contextmenu / click events on the badge fire on
 * the badge element and bubble through the DOM to the wrapper, where xyflow's
 * onContextMenu / onClick handlers correctly dispatch to onNodeContextMenu /
 * onNodeClick. Without this (with `pointer-events: none`), hit-testing
 * skips the badge and falls through to the React Flow pane underneath —
 * since the badge area is geometrically outside the wrapper — and the
 * right-click fires onPaneContextMenu (the canvas Paste menu) instead.
