 *  • `'pin-own'` — drop landed on the moving endpoint's OWN node. The user
 *    dragged the endpoint dot around its own node to choose a specific
 *    attachment point; the caller projects the cursor onto that node's
 *    perimeter (closest side + t) and commits via onPinEndpoint.
 *  • `'reconnect-and-pin'` — drop landed on a THIRD node. Per the "cursor

 *    the caller reconnects to the new node AND pins at the projected
 *    perimeter point in a single onReconnectConnector patch so the new
