/**
 * Abstraction-rule fixtures for the `seeflow-node-planner` sub-agent.
 *
 * These are the canonical input/output pairs a correct planner must satisfy.
 * They are exported from a NON-test module so a future LLM-eval harness can
 * import them without tripping Biome's `noExportsInTest` rule. The companion
 * file `test-abstraction-rules.test.ts` consumes these to assert internal
 * consistency of the contract itself.
 *
 * Each fixture pairs:
 *   - a synthetic discoverer brief (`contextBrief`) — the planner's input
 *   - the `expected` node-count + node-name-set + trigger pick a correct
 *     planner would emit, plus free-text `rationaleNotes` documenting the
 *     justification the planner should cite in `oneNodeRationale`.
 *
 * No LLM is invoked in tests. The contract lives here so drift between the
 * sub-agent prompt's abstraction rules and the fixtures shows up as a test
 * failure rather than silent rot.
